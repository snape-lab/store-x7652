# The Jorhat Marketplace V1

Just a simple site to list some products my cousing said he wanted to sell (Idk where he got them from). Built this site just for him as he said he needed a website to showcase his products.

The logo is designed by **me**.
The website is designed by **me**.
The website is built by **me**. (using [Astro](https://astro.build) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com))

The business is **NOT owned or run by me** nor do I have any idea on how it works.
