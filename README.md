# The Jorhat Marketplace V1

Just a simple site to list some products my cousin said he wanted to sell (Idk where he got them from). Built this site just for him as he said he needed a website to showcase his products.

- The logo is designed by **me**.
- The website is designed by **me**.
- The website is built by **me**. (using [Astro](https://astro.build) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com))

- The business is **NOT owned or run by me** nor do I have any idea on how it works.

### Coming Next

- Responsiveness. (Coming up soon, got this entire thing done in almost a day including learning a new framework and trying out 3 CMS (content management systems))

Oh and yeah in case you're wondering, I'm from Jorhat as well.
